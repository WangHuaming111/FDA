# This is the code for ICME-2023 paper "General GAN-Generated Image Detection by Data Augmentation in Fingerprint Domain."

The code was uploaded to the Github repository of our research group (Muiltimedia Security and Forensics Group, MSFG) after the paper was accepted in 2023.
This is my personal Github repository, and the contents of both repositories are exactly the same.

Old paper code Github repository: https://github.com/MSFG/FDA.
